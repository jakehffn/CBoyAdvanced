# CBoyAdvanced

**A C/WASM GameBoy Advanced (GBA) emulator**

This is an emulator for the GameBoy Advanced. It can be built natively or to a WASM target using Emscripten.


## ⚠️WORK IN-PROGRESS⚠️
This project is very early in development. Don't expect anything to be emulated soon. It is buildable though, and unit tests will continue to be added as progress is made.
